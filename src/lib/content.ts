          'A stretch ceiling is a thin, seamless membrane — either knitted polyester or a calendered PVC film — that is tensioned across a room and clipped into a slim profile fixed around the perimeter walls. The result looks like a perfectly flat, freshly painted ceiling, but there is no plaster, no sanding and no painting involved.',
          'Because the membrane is fitted to a frame rather than fixed directly to the structure above, it hides pipework, wiring, uneven concrete and old ceilings completely — and it can be installed in a single day, in a room that stays furnished and in use.',

NRC (Noise Reduction Coefficient) is the equivalent single-number rating used more often in North America.',

  {
    q: 'What is a stretch ceiling?',
    a: 'A stretch ceiling is a thin, seamless membrane — polyester or PVC film — tensioned across a room and clipped into a slim perimeter profile. It looks like a perfectly flat painted ceiling but installs with no plaster, no sanding and no painting, and hides everything above it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does installation take?',
    a: 'Most rooms are finished in a single day. A two-person team fits up to roughly 50 m² per day. Cold-mounted polyester needs no drying time, so the room is usable immediately.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is it messy? Do I need to move out?',
    a: 'No. There is no demolition, dust, sanding or painting, so installation can take place in a furnished, occupied room. The existing ceiling can usually stay in place underneath.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does a stretch ceiling last?',
    a: 'Our systems carry a 25-year warranty. The surface is washable and humidity-proof, and will not crack, flake, yellow or need repainting.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can it improve acoustics?',
    a: 'Yes. A micro-perforated, absorber-backed version reaches up to Class A sound absorption while looking identical to the standard finish — measurably reducing reverberation and noise.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the widest ceiling you can install without a seam?',
    a: 'Up to 5.7 m seamless with PVC film, and up to 5.15 m with polyester. Larger spans are covered with a near-invisible welded joint or a deliberate profile line.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I have lighting, backlighting or a printed design?',
    a: 'Yes. Translucent films give an even, dimmable backlight with no hotspots, LED line lighting integrates into the surface, and any image — including a starry sky — can be printed edge-to-edge.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does a stretch ceiling cost?',
    a: 'Pricing is project-based — it depends on the surface area, the system, finish and any lighting or acoustic options. Request a free, no-obligation quote and a specialist will reply within two working days.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you work with contractors and resellers?',
    a: 'Yes. STRETCH is B2B-led: we train installers at our Belgian HQ, supply made-to-measure membranes through a B2B portal, and refer local customers to certified partners. See the Partners and Installer training pages.',
