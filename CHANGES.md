## 2026-08-06 (2) — Portfolio: 8 case studies migrated from the old site

- Migrated from old stretchplafond.be pages (EN copy distilled from the Dutch
  originals; `projects` messages translations = follow-up, EN falls back
  meanwhile via new has() guards in ProjectRoute): ’t Vier Emmershof (Lokeren),
  Villa VP-193, Villa JPV-210, BEN Home VDB-222 (Sint-Pauwels), VAP — Sint-
  Pauwels (VA-176), Goesten & Opdam, DHL Zaventem (Boeing 737 meeting room),
  Veta Interieur showroom (Dendermonde). Portfolio now 22 projects (matches the
  old site's inspiration section).
- Photos processed into `public/images/projects/` for Vier Emmershof, VP-193,
  JPV-210, VDB-222 (hero 16:9 + 3-image 4:3 galleries) and Goesten & Opdam
  (hero); Veta reuses the illuminated-print photo; VAP + DHL show the
  "photos coming soon" chip until their photo sets arrive.
- Fixed: ProjectRoute crashed the title (MISSING_MESSAGE → blank h1) for any
  project without a messages entry; both localizeProject call sites now guard
  with tpr.has() and fall back to the English source. (PortfolioGrid already
  guarded.)
- Review notes for Michael: Goesten & Opdam copy is inferred from the photo +
  old listing line (RAL-colour acoustic ceiling, Tenback) — please verify;
  facts for JPV-210 kept minimal (old page is offline).

## 2026-08-06 — Phone, partners photo, portal accounts (B2C signup), lead email

- **Company phone** → `+32 474 52 20 90` (`lib/site-config.ts`: phone/phoneDisplay/
  phoneHref; used by header, footer, contact, JSON-LD). Old +32 3 284 68 18 removed.
- **Partners page hero photo**: `pageImages.partners` now reuses the homepage
  installer photo (`/images/home/installer.jpg`).
- **Portal — open self-registration with account tiers** (see docs/PORTAL.md):
  new `account_type` ('b2c'|'b2b') on `portal_users` (+ one-line migration for
  existing DBs in schema.sql). "Create account" tab on /portal/login →
  `POST /api/portal/signup` (Supabase signUp + b2c profile; login self-heals a
  missing profile). B2C accounts get their own dashboard (account tile + trade
  upsell) but NO pricelist/designer — enforced in pages, the designer API route
  and by RLS (no markets granted). Admin panel: B2B/B2C badge + one-click
  Upgrade to B2B / Set to B2C; admin-created accounts stay b2b. 21 new portal
  i18n keys translated in all 12 locales.
- **Demo logins hidden by default**: demo mode (and its listed credentials) now
  requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTAL_DEMO=1`; without Supabase env vars the login
  page shows a "portal launching soon" notice and no credentials work.
- **Lead email**: no code change needed — `lib/deliver.ts` already tries
  Resend → webhook → SMTP. Following the re-sound.be pattern (Power Automate →
  leads@stretchgroup.be), set `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL` in Vercel to the same Power
  Automate flow URL. `LEAD_DESTINATION` already defaults to leads@stretchgroup.be.
- **CTA audit fix**: the quote/lead modal (`LeadGenModal`) was the only form
  WITHOUT the `_gotcha` honeypot (ContactForm + InlineLeadForm had it) — added,
  so all lead entry points now share the same spam protection.

## 2026-08-05 — Portfolio: CitizenM case study + first project photos + "coming soon"

- **CitizenM Hotel rewritten as a full case study** (facts from saniskill.nl and
  the old stretchplafond.be post): Saniskill builds the prefab pods, STRETCH
  engineered the illuminated ceiling — TWO backlit stretch panels per pod, every
  panel removable so the ceiling doubles as a full-surface inspection hatch;
  2,608 shower pods delivered across Europe & America (Paris Opera, Copenhagen
  Rådhuspladsen, NYC, Chicago, Miami Brickell, Washington DC, Seattle, SF, LA,
  Nuenen). New facts row (Units), solutions now incl. `inspection-hatch`,
  featured on the grid. Copy translated in ALL 12 locales (`projects.citizenm-hotel`).
- **First real portfolio photos** (`public/images/projects/`): CitizenM (hero +
  6-image gallery incl. the standalone pod product shot), BNP Paribas Fortis
  (luminous oval hero + 3 gallery), Polette Eyewear (piano-lid hero + 3 gallery,
  now featured), Rue Perrée (luminous gallery hero + 2 gallery).
- **"Photos coming soon" chip** on portfolio cards without a photo
  (`PortfolioGrid`, new `projectCards.comingSoon` key ×12 locales).
- **Held back for later** (no matching project pages yet, per Michael): ZEBRA
  Huis, Creneau–AFAS Lounge, Candor, Vier Emmershof, Tenback–Goesten Opdam and
  code-named villa sets JPV-210 / VP-193 / VDB-222 — photo sets received and
  archived, waiting for project titles/details.

## 2026-07-26 — Prefab Structures page: hero title fix + first real photos

**What changed**

- **Hero title no longer runs behind the photo.** The prefab pages used the
  full-page `.h1` scale (up to 142px) inside a half-width hero column, so
  "PREFAB STRUCTURES" (and worse, long localized names) bled under the hero
  image. `PrefabPage` now sizes the hero `<h1>` per locale (`H1_SIZE` map,
  largest size at which that locale's longest word still fits the column at any
  viewport — measured in Archivo wdth 125), with `text-wrap: balance` +
  hyphenation/wrap safety nets. Verified headless across all 12 locales × 7
  viewport widths × both prefab pages: zero overflow / overlap / mid-word
  breaks. (Done in TS rather than `:lang()` CSS because the currently deployed
  tree still nests two `<html>` elements — the outer `lang="en"` would defeat
  `:lang()`; see the 11 Jul SEO-fix notes.)
- **Production photos added** (`public/images/prefab/`): laser cutting, laser
  welding and powder-coating photos now fill the three "Made in-house" detail
  slots (`detail-cutting.jpg`, `detail-welding.jpg`, `detail-powdercoating.jpg`).
- **"Floating coving ceiling" showcase is now the BelOrta case** (Sint-Katelijne-
  Waver): production drawing SP-2025-11-45 (A1 sheet rendered from the AutoCAD
  PDF to `show-coving-drawing.png`), the installed round coving
  (`show-coving-result.jpg`) and the finished space with the red acoustic
  cylinders (`show-coving-result2.jpg`). `PrefabShowcase` gained an optional
  `result2` slot — when present the showcase renders a 3-up row (drawing /
  installed / finished space) with a new numbered caption. New i18n key
  `prefabPage.finishedSpace` added to all 12 locales.
- **"Raster grid ceiling" showcase** keeps its placeholders — photos still to
  come from Michael.
- **Removed `src/app/sitemap.ts`** (route collision): it shadowed the host-aware
  `src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts` and made `next dev`/`next build` fail outright
  ("same specificity as an optional catch-all route"). This re-applies part of
  the 11 Jul SEO fix (commit 107a835) that this tree was missing.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` clean; `next build` (fonts stubbed offline) OK;
Playwright screenshots of hero (en/pl/sv/is, desktop+mobile), production grid
and 3-up showcase all render correctly.

**Same day, second batch — six more photos placed:**

- Prefab Structures hero → `prefab/prefab-structures-hero.jpg` (Uhoda tower red
  backlit grid); Prefab Lighting Elements hero → `prefab/prefab-lighting-hero.jpg`
  (CitizenM San Francisco).
- Illuminated page "Printed designs" → `products/illuminated-printed-stretch-ceiling.jpg`
  (Veta interieur bathroom print).
- Custom-print page "Print plus backlight" → `products/printed-backlit-stretch-ceiling.jpg`
  (Glennwood / Johnson & Johnson); "Made to your space" →
  `products/custom-print-made-to-your-space.jpg` (showroom coving).
- Installer-training hero now wired to `pageImages.training` →
  `pages/training.jpg` (membrane tuck-in shot); the page previously rendered a
  bare placeholder with no `src` at all.
- Still awaiting files: "Your image, edge to edge" (Bert Demasure_Blondeel
  Argendael print03.jpg), partners "Installer / team photo" (installer.jpg),
  and an "LED line lighting" photo for the Illuminated page.

## 2026-07-09 — Ceiling designer in the portal (pro area)

**What was built** 

- **`/portal/designer`** — the ABC Floorplan ceiling designer (measure → draw → seams → quote → order) now lives inside the client portal, next to the pricelist. Nav link + dashboard tile ("live") added; translated in all 12 locales.
- **Auth-gated delivery:** the designer is a single self-contained HTML app embedded base64 in `src/lib/portal/designer-html.ts` and served ONLY through `GET /api/portal/designer` after `getPortalSession()` passes (anonymous → 307 to `/portal/login`). It is deliberately NOT in `/public` because the app contains the Stretch foil price matrix and service rates. Response headers: `private, no-store`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`.
- **Embedding:** `src/app/[locale]/portal/(app)/designer/page.tsx` renders the app full-height in an iframe pointed at the API route. The tool itself is locale-independent (English UI, as built).
- **No database (per Michael's request):** the order flow downloads the order files (floorplan PDF, production PDF, DXF, order.json) and opens a pre-filled email draft. Persisting orders/documents server-side is a documented future step (an `/api/portal/orders` route + Supabase table + real attachment email would slot in without touching the designer).
- **Updating the tool:** replace `abc-floorplan.html` and run the one-liner in `scripts/update-designer.md` to regenerate the embedded module. No other file changes needed.

**Files:** new `src/lib/portal/designer-html.ts`, `src/app/api/portal/designer/route.ts`, `src/app/[locale]/portal/(app)/designer/page.tsx`, `scripts/update-designer.md`; modified `src/components/portal/PortalNav.tsx`, `src/app/[locale]/portal/(app)/page.tsx`, all 12 `messages/*.json` (keys `portal.nav.designer`, `portal.dash.tileDesigner*`, `portal.designer.*`).

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` clean; `next build` succeeds; Playwright: anonymous requests to the page and the API both redirect to login, demo login → designer renders inside the portal shell, tool solves the 15-corner reference room (SVG draws, spec table computes), nav/tile/locale (nl) all OK.

## 2026-07-11 — Body-copy i18n phase 1: home page, CTA band, product templates

**What changed**

- Extracted all hardcoded English copy from the HOME page (Hero incl. 4 slides,
  Ticker, Stats, WhyStretch, Solutions, Acoustics, ApplicationAreas, Gallery,
  InstallerPartner, Reviews headings), the site-wide CTA band, the solution-page
  TEMPLATE (breadcrumbs, CTAs, section headings, colours note, datasheet labels)
  and the products overview page into new `home`, `ctaBand`, `productPage` and
  `productsPage` namespaces in `messages/*.json` — translated in ALL 12 locales
  (~160 keys each, native industry terminology; 390 keys total per locale, full
  parity verified).
- Result: the home page and all product-page chrome now render fully native on
  every domain (verified fr/pl/de rendered output — zero residual English in the
  extracted sections; EN output unchanged).

**Still English (phase 2+ — needs extraction + translation per surface)**

- Product CATALOG text in `lib/products.ts` (names/intros/features/specs/FAQs
  per product) — appears on product pages below the translated chrome.
- `lib/content.ts` (global FAQs, blog posts, reviews, projects), technical.ts,
  prefab.ts, applications.ts, forms-config.ts, partners / installer-training /
  about page bodies.

## 2026-07-10 — Ceiling designer cut-out fixes + per-domain SEO repairs

**Ceiling designer (`src/lib/portal/designer-html.ts`)**

- Corner numbers ① ② ③ always visible on rectangle cut-outs (also before any tape).
- General 3-point solver: ANY mix of >=3 tapes over corners ①②③ now positions the
  rectangle — including one tape each from three room corners (θ-scan + Levenberg–
  Marquardt polish, verified against scipy least-squares). Exact 2+1 path kept.
- Per-tape Δ accuracy report; tape lines on the plan coloured by fit (violet OK,
  orange 1–3 cm, red >3 cm with Δ printed). Same-corner mistakes get a specific error.

**SEO (every language/domain)**

- REMOVED `src/app/layout.tsx`: it rendered `<html lang="en">` around the
  `[locale]` layout's own `<html lang>` → nested/duplicate html tags on every page.
  The `[locale]` layout (which already loads fonts + globals) is now the root, as
  per the next-intl domain-routing pattern. Every domain now serves exactly one
  `<html>` with the correct BCP-47 lang.
- REMOVED `src/app/sitemap.ts`: the legacy path-prefixed sitemap was shadowing the
  host-aware `sitemap.xml/route.ts`, so every domain served `stretchplafond.com/en…`
  URLs (which redirect). Each domain now serves its own 53 clean URLs.
- REMOVED `public/robots.txt`: the static file was shadowing the host-aware
  `robots.txt/route.ts` and advertised the `.be` sitemap on all 12 domains. Robots
  is now per-domain (correct `Sitemap:` line) and keeps the `/portal` disallows.
- Audited per-language metadata on rendered pages: titles/descriptions localized with
  native industry keywords (spanplafonds / plafonds tendus / Spanndecken / sufity
  napinane / …), hreflang cluster (12 + x-default) present, canonical per domain,
  og:locale correct, portal noindex intact.

**Translation state (analysis)**

- `messages/*.json`: 229 keys × 12 locales, full parity, native-quality strings.
- Remaining untranslated surface: ~468 hardcoded English strings in code —
  `lib/content.ts` (140: FAQs, blog, reviews), `lib/products.ts` (100),
  `lib/prefab.ts` (31), partners page (29), `lib/technical.ts` (24),
  `lib/forms-config.ts` (21), `lib/applications.ts` (15), installer-training (14),
  plus ~40 in home/section components. Translating these needs the copy extracted
  to a locale-aware content layer — recommended as dedicated phases (1: home +
  products, 2: content.ts, 3: technical/prefab/partners/training).

---

## 2026-07-08 — Client portal (login + live pricelist)

**What was built**

- **`/portal`** — a login-gated client platform: dashboard, **pricelist** (category tabs, search, market filter, EUR/PLN switch, print stylesheet, CSV export — layout follows Michael's pricelist mockup restyled to the site tokens), and an **admin page** (Excel sync + client-account management). All portal routes are `noindex`, excluded from sitemaps and disallowed in robots.
- **Data flow:** the *Alto Pricing System* Excel stays the pricing master. The admin upload (or `scripts/seed-pricebook.mjs`) reads ONLY the client-safe PriceBook columns (Category, Code, Product, Unit, Market, Price EUR, Price PLN) into a Supabase `pricebook` table. **Margin % and cost columns are never read, stored, or transmitted.**
- **Auth & visibility:** Supabase password auth; `portal_users` profiles carry `role` (client/admin), `markets[]`, `all_markets`, `active`. Per-market price visibility is enforced with **Postgres row-level security** (see `supabase/schema.sql`), not just UI filtering — deliberate, since margins differ per market (East/West Europe, USA, UAE, Key account, Producers, Standard, rolls tiers).
- **Zero-config demo mode** (consistent with the site's env-var philosophy): without Supabase env vars the portal runs on a bundled sample pricebook (`src/lib/portal/demo-pricebook.json`, generated from the 2026-07 workbook, 2,447 rows) with three demo logins listed on the login page. Demo mode is a preview, not a security boundary.
- **Session refresh** composed into `src/middleware.ts` (next-intl first, then Supabase token refresh on `/portal` paths only). Root `middleware.ts` mirrors it.
- New deps: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `xlsx`. New env vars (all optional): `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Added `.env.example` (README referenced it but it was missing).
- Entry points: header utility bar, mobile menu and footer "Company" column link to `/portal` (`common.nav.clientLogin` / `footer.links.clientPortal`, translated in all 12 locales; the full portal UI ships translated in all 12 message bundles — same native-review caveat as the rest).
- Setup guide: **`docs/PORTAL.md`** (Supabase project → schema.sql → 3 env vars → seed script → admin bootstrap script).

**Decisions / notes for review**

- Rows are keyed on Category+Product+Market; a product rename in Excel shows as removed+added in the sync report (expected).
- 4 PriceBook rows currently have no Price EUR (Bauf Translucent Satin/Mat White 450 cm — cost cell empty in the workbook) and are skipped with a warning at sync time; fix them in the Excel when convenient.
- The pricelist's product grouping inside a category derives the brand from the first word of the product name for ceilings/rolls/foil-cut (MSD, Bauf, Teqtum, Renolit…). Other categories render as a single list — add richer grouping later if wanted.
- Documents & order-history tiles on the dashboard are staged "coming soon" placeholders — the portal was explicitly designed as a platform for more client data sources.

## 2026-07-05 — Multi-domain internationalization (12 locales, one domain each)

**What changed**

- `src/i18n/config.ts` is now the single source of truth for **12 locales** (`en, be, nl, fr, pl, de, es, pt, da, sv, no, is`) and their **production domains** (`localeDomains` map — edit domains ONLY here). `be` is a market code for Dutch-Belgium; browsers/search engines only ever see the mapped BCP-47 codes (`nl-BE`, `nl-NL`, `nb-NO`, ...).
- **Domain-based routing** via next-intl `defineRouting({ domains })` with `localePrefix: 'as-needed'`: each domain serves ONE locale with clean, unprefixed URLs (`stretchplafond.nl/products`). Unknown hosts (localhost, `*.vercel.app` previews) keep path-prefixed access to every locale (`/fr`, `/pl`, ...) for dev & QA.
- `middleware.ts` moved to `src/middleware.ts` — REQUIRED: with a `src/` directory Next.js only loads middleware from `src/`, the root file was silently ignored.
- Root layout merged into `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` (the next-intl documented pattern) so `<html lang>` is the correct BCP-47 code per locale.
- **SEO is fully cross-domain**: `buildCanonical`/`buildAlternates` in `src/lib/seo.ts` emit per-domain canonicals and a 13-entry hreflang cluster (12 locales + `x-default` → the `en` domain). All page/OG/JSON-LD URLs use the new `localeBase(locale)` helper. Organization `@id`/logo stay pinned to `siteUrl` (the `.com`) so the brand keeps one schema.org entity across all domains.
- `app/sitemap.ts` replaced by **host-aware** `app/sitemap.xml/route.ts`: each domain serves ONLY its own URLs, each with `xhtml:link` hreflang alternates to the sibling domains. Static `public/robots.txt` replaced by host-aware `app/robots.txt/route.ts` (same crawl policy, per-domain `Sitemap:` line).
- `LanguageSwitcher` is now a full 12-language dropdown that navigates **across domains** in production (preserving path + query) and falls back to in-app locale switching on dev/preview hosts.
- Lead-modal privacy link no longer hardcodes `/en/privacy` (locale-aware `Link`), consent sentence is translated (`forms.consentPrefix`). `/training` legacy 308 redirect now uses the locale-aware `permanentRedirect`.
- **Message bundles for all 12 locales** in `messages/` with verified key parity. Translations are solid working drafts — have a native speaker review marketing copy before launch (especially da/sv/no/is industry terms).

**Deploying (Vercel)**

1. Add ALL 12 domains to the same Vercel project (Settings → Domains). Do NOT set any of them to redirect — each must "Serve" the deployment. Point DNS (A/CNAME per Vercel's instructions) for each.
2. The Host header decides the locale — no env vars required. Optionally override a domain per environment with `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_<LOCALE>`.
3. After launch, add each domain as a separate property in Google Search Console and submit `https://<domain>/sitemap.xml`.

# CHANGES — Build log & decisions

This document records the choices, assumptions, and deviations made while building the STRETCH website from the brief + design mockups, plus everything that needs human review before launch.

---

## Day 0 — Initial build

A complete, production-ready marketing site was built from the "Zero-to-Production" prompt, the finalized Brand Brief, and the seven design mockups (Homepage, Solution Page, Inspiration, Become a Reseller, Installer Training, Contact, CtaModal).

### Stack (as locked in the brief)

- **Next.js 14** (App Router), static-export-compatible patterns, TypeScript **strict**.
- **next-intl 3.x** with `localePrefix: 'always'`.
- **styled-jsx** + token-driven `globals.css` (no Tailwind).
- **next/font** self-hosted; **next/image** only; **lucide-react** for icons.
- **Vercel** deploy target; server-side form handling via route handlers; consent in `localStorage`; animations via CSS + IntersectionObserver only.

`tsc --noEmit` passes clean, and a full `next build` prerenders all 23 routes successfully.

---

## Decisions & assumptions

1. **English-only launch, i18n fully wired.** Per the brief, `locales = ['en']`. `next-intl` is fully plumbed so adding `nl` / `fr` / `de` later is a one-line change plus a message file. Reusable chrome (nav, CTAs, forms, cookies, footer, meta) lives in `messages/en.json`; long-form page **body** copy is authored in English directly in the section components and earmarked for extraction when more locales are enabled.
2. **Products: one folder per product.** Five solution pages, each its own route under `src/app/[locale]/products/<slug>/`, sharing a single `SolutionPage` component and a shared `ProductRoute` helper (so each route file is ~3 lines). Slugs: `polyester-stretch-ceiling`, `pvc-stretch-ceiling`, `acoustic-stretch-system`, `light-print-stretch-ceiling`, `prefab-ceiling-unit`.
3. **Graceful, zero-config lead delivery.** `lib/deliver.ts` auto-selects a method at runtime: Resend → webhook → SMTP (Nodemailer) → log-only. The site runs with no env vars (log-only). `resend` / `nodemailer` are optional dependencies, imported dynamically only when configured. Submitted PII is never logged (only source, destination and the submitter's email domain).
4. **Text wordmark logo.** "STRETCH®" is rendered as type (matching the mockups). Brand favicons and a 512×512 Organization logo were generated (red mark / black wordmark).
5. **Analytics per brief.** GA4 = yes, Microsoft Clarity = yes, Bing UET = no, Meta Pixel = no. GA always loads but is gated by Consent Mode v2 (default denied). Clarity loads on analytics consent. Meta/Bing components are present but return `null` unless their env var is set.

---

## Deviations from the brief / mockups

1. **`<html>` consolidation.** Only the **root** `app/layout.tsx` renders `<html lang="en-BE">` and applies the font variable; `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` does **not** render a second `<html>`. This avoids nested-html issues with the App Router while keeping locale-aware metadata.
2. **Navigation simplified.** The header is Solutions (dropdown of the 5 products) / Inspiration / Partners / Contact, plus a utility bar (reseller, training, phone, language). The mockup's "Technical" mega-menu was folded into the per-product spec sections and the FAQ, rather than a separate top-level menu — clearer hierarchy, fewer thin pages.
3. **Display font = variable Archivo (width axis), not a separate "Archivo Expanded" family.** Google Fonts no longer ships "Archivo Expanded" as a standalone family (`next/font/google` has no such export); the expanded look is the **width (`wdth`) axis** of the single variable Archivo font, pushed to `125` via `font-variation-settings` in `globals.css`. Visual result matches the mockups while keeping one self-hosted font.
4. **Image placeholders instead of raster stand-ins.** Every photographic slot renders a branded diagonal-hatch placeholder (`components/ui/Placeholder`) rather than a raster image, so the build ships with no copyrighted or dummy photography. Search the codebase for `Placeholder` to find every slot to replace with real `next/image` assets.
5. **Sitemap is dynamic.** `app/sitemap.ts` generates `sitemap.xml` (locales × routes + hreflang + `x-default`). There is intentionally **no** static `public/sitemap.xml`.

---

## Drafted content — REVIEW BEFORE LAUNCH

The following content was drafted from category norms and the brief, and should be reviewed/replaced by the client:

- **Customer reviews** (`lib/content.ts → reviews`): three placeholder testimonials with initials-style names. **No `aggregateRating` is emitted in JSON-LD** until real, permission-cleared reviews are in place. Replace with genuine Google reviews (with permission) and only then consider adding rating schema.
- **FAQ** (`lib/content.ts → globalFaqs`, 9 items): drafted answers to standard stretch-ceiling questions. Verify each against your actual products, warranty and process.
- **Blog/guides** (`lib/content.ts → blogPosts`, 2 articles): drafted educational posts ("What is a stretch ceiling?", "Stretch ceiling acoustics explained"). Review for accuracy and brand voice; add more over time.
- **Per-product FAQs & spec values** (`lib/products.ts`): technical values (spans, classes, warranty, recyclability) are drawn from the brief/mockups and are indicative — confirm before publishing.
- **About page copy** (`app/[locale]/about/page.tsx`): drafted company story. Confirm founding year, history and the office footprint.
- **Privacy & Terms** (`app/[locale]/privacy`, `/terms`): drafted as starting points and **must be reviewed by a qualified legal advisor** to reflect your actual data-processing practices and contractual terms.
- **Contact details** (`lib/site-config.ts`): phone, emails, addresses and geo-coordinates are taken from the brief — verify all are current.

---

## Open questions for the client

- Final production domain for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (assumed `https://stretchplafond.be`).
- Preferred lead-delivery method and verified sending domain (Resend recommended).
- Whether the residential/e-commerce ("DIY kit") path should eventually link from this B2B-led site, and how it should relate to the booking funnel.
- Real GA4 and Clarity IDs.
- Confirmation of training dates, seat counts and venue before they go live (`lib/forms-config.ts`).

---

## Known notes

- A local `next build` downloads the Archivo font from Google at build time; in network-restricted environments that single step fails while everything else compiles. Vercel builds have network access, so this is a non-issue in deployment. Type-checking never needs network.
- `next@14.2.x`: keep patch versions current. If `npm audit` flags an advisory for the pinned version, bump within the 14.2 line (`npm install next@^14.2`) and re-run `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build`.
